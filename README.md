# Server Management

A mini project included in a course I took, about new syntax & features introduced in the latest versions of Angular.
I took the chance to use it to practice Angular Material and SASS by adding a lot of extras, aiming a beautiful Interface and a good User experience.
It uses signals for a Zoneless result.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.0.

## The Project

Uses Goolgle's [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) Component Library.

```
ng add @angular/material
```

And the [Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/) Preprocessor.
```
npm install --save-dev sass
```
